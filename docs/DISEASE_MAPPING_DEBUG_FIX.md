# Disease Mapping Debug Fix

## Issue Found
**Problem:** "Corn(Maize) Northern Leaf Blight" prediction was showing as "Healthy Plant"

**Root Cause:** The model was returning predictions in a different format than expected:
- Expected: `"Corn_(maize)___Northern_Leaf_Blight"` (underscores)
- Actual: `"Corn(Maize) Northern Leaf Blight"` (spaces)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Extraction Logic
Updated `extractDiseaseName()` to handle multiple format patterns:

```typescript
// Now handles:
"Apple___Apple_scab"              // Original format (triple underscore)
"Corn(Maize) Northern Leaf Blight" // Space-separated with parentheses
"Tomato Early blight"             // Simple space separation
```

The function now uses regex patterns to detect and extract disease names from alternative formats.

### 2. Added Space Variants to Mapping
Added space-separated variants for all diseases to handle both formats:

```typescript
// Original (underscore format)
"Northern_Leaf_Blight": "late_blight",

// New (space format)
"Northern Leaf Blight": "late_blight",
```

This ensures the mapping works regardless of which format the model returns.

### 3. Comprehensive Console Logging
Added detailed logging at every step:

```typescript
// Input
üîç [MAPPING] Input prediction: "Corn(Maize) Northern Leaf Blight"
üîç [MAPPING] Extracted disease name: "Northern Leaf Blight"

// Mapping
üó∫Ô∏è [MAPPING] Looking up: "Northern Leaf Blight"
üó∫Ô∏è [MAPPING] Found disease ID: "late_blight"

// Routing
üìç [ROUTING] Getting routing info for: "Corn(Maize) Northern Leaf Blight"
üìç [ROUTING] Result: { diseaseId: "late_blight", isRoutable: true, displayName: "..." }
```

If a mapping is not found, you'll see:
```typescript
‚ö†Ô∏è [MAPPING] No mapping found for: "Unknown Disease"
‚ö†Ô∏è [MAPPING] Full prediction was: "Plant___Unknown Disease"
‚ö†Ô∏è [MAPPING] Available mappings: Apple_scab, Black_rot, ...
```

## Testing the Fix

### Expected Behavior Now
1. User scans corn with Northern Leaf Blight
2. Model predicts: `"Corn(Maize) Northern Leaf Blight"`
3. System extracts: `"Northern Leaf Blight"`
4. Mapping finds: `"late_blight"`
5. Card shows: "Disease Detected" (not "Healthy Plant")
6. Card is clickable with chevron
7. Routes to: `/details/late_blight`

### Debug Output
Check the console logs to see the mapping process:
```
üîç [MAPPING] Input prediction: Corn(Maize) Northern Leaf Blight
üîç [MAPPING] Used alternative extraction pattern
üîç [MAPPING] Extracted disease name: Northern Leaf Blight
üó∫Ô∏è [MAPPING] Looking up: Northern Leaf Blight
üó∫Ô∏è [MAPPING] Found disease ID: late_blight
üìç [ROUTING] Getting routing info for: Corn(Maize) Northern Leaf Blight
üìç [ROUTING] Result: { diseaseId: 'late_blight', isRoutable: true, displayName: 'Corn(Maize) - Northern Leaf Blight' }
```

## Complete List of Space Variants Added

All diseases now support both underscore and space formats:

| Underscore Format | Space Format | Disease ID |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| Apple_scab | Apple scab | scab |
| Black_rot | Black rot | black_rot |
| Cedar_apple_rust | Cedar apple rust | rust |
| Powdery_mildew | Powdery mildew | powdery_mildew |
| Northern_Leaf_Blight | Northern Leaf Blight | late_blight |
| Common_rust_ | Common rust | rust |
| Bacterial_spot | Bacterial spot | bacterial_spot |
| Early_blight | Early blight | early_blight |
| Late_blight | Late blight | late_blight |
| Leaf_scorch | Leaf scorch | leaf_scorch |
| Leaf_Mold | Leaf Mold | leaf_mold |
| Septoria_leaf_spot | Septoria leaf spot | leaf_spot |
| Target_Spot | Target Spot | target_spot |
| Tomato_mosaic_virus | Tomato mosaic virus | mosaic_virus |
| Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus | Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus | leaf_curl_virus |

## Why This Happened

The model output format can vary based on:
1. **Training data preprocessing** - how labels were formatted during training
2. **Model export/conversion** - label format may change during export
3. **API formatting** - the FastAPI endpoint might format predictions differently
4. **Framework differences** - different ML frameworks handle class labels differently

## Prevention for Future

### When Adding New Diseases
Always add both formats to the mapping:

```typescript
// Good - both formats
"New_Disease": "new_disease",
"New Disease": "new_disease", // Space variant

// Bad - only one format
"New_Disease": "new_disease", // Missing space variant!
```

### When Retraining Model
1. Check the actual prediction format by logging raw model output
2. Update mappings to match the new format
3. Add both underscore and space variants to be safe
4. Test with console logs to verify mapping works

## Troubleshooting

### Still showing as healthy?
Check the console logs:
- Is the disease name being extracted correctly?
- Is it finding the mapping?
- Does the mapping key match exactly (case-sensitive)?

### New prediction format?
If you see a warning like:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è [MAPPING] No mapping found for: Some_New_Format
```

Add the new format to the mapping:
```typescript
"Some_New_Format": "appropriate_disease_id",
"Some New Format": "appropriate_disease_id", // Space variant
```

## Files Changed

1. **`lib/diseaseMapping.ts`**
   - Enhanced `extractDiseaseName()` with multi-format support
   - Added console logs to `mapPredictionToDiseaseId()`
   - Added console logs to `getRoutingInfo()`
   - Added space variants for all diseases

## Summary

‚úÖ Fixed: Northern Leaf Blight now routes correctly  
‚úÖ Added: Comprehensive logging for debugging  
‚úÖ Added: Support for space-separated format  
‚úÖ Added: Dual format support for all diseases  
‚úÖ Future-proof: Handles multiple prediction formats automatically

The system is now more robust and will handle format variations from the ML model!
